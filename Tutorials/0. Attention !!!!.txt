Beware of Server restarts, especially when using a network drive.

The time of running these python scripts, can be quite high, so plan your time if you have weekly server restarts.

If running out of Memory, try a system with more resources.
Or set 
os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = "-1"
so that the code runs in CPU mode.
Or choose the second gpu by using os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = "1".

You can also set the env variable from the cmd-line.
